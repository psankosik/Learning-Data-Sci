    "In this exercise, you will implement linear regression and get to see it work on data. Before starting on this programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the information you need for solving this assignment is in this notebook, and all the code you will be implementing will take place within this notebook. The assignment can be promptly submitted to the coursera grader directly from this notebook (code and instructions are included below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin with the exercises, we need to import all libraries required for this programming exercise. Throughout the course, we will be using [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) for all arrays and matrix operations, and [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting.\n",

    "You can find instructions on how to install required libraries in the README file in the [github repository](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments)."

    "- Python array indices start from zero, not one (contrary to OCTAVE/MATLAB). \n",
    "\n",
    "- There is an important distinction between python arrays (called `list` or `tuple`) and `numpy` arrays. You should use `numpy` arrays in all your computations. Vector/matrix operations work only with `numpy` arrays. Python lists do not support vector operations (you need to use for loops).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are seeing many errors at runtime, inspect your matrix operations to make sure that you are adding and multiplying matrices of compatible dimensions. Printing the dimensions of `numpy` arrays using the `shape` property will help you debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By default, `numpy` interprets math operators to be element-wise operators. If you want to do matrix multiplication, you need to use the `dot` function in `numpy`. For, example if `A` and `B` are two `numpy` matrices, then the matrix operation AB is `np.dot(A, B)`. Note that for 2-dimensional matrices or vectors (1-dimensional), this is also equivalent to `A@B` (requires python >= 3.5)."

Many other problems that you will encounter in real life are multi-dimensional and cannot be plotted on a 2-d plot.

    "As you program, make sure you understand what you are trying to optimize and what is being updated. Keep in mind that the cost $J(\\theta)$ is parameterized by the vector $\\theta$, not $X$ and $y$. That is, we minimize the value of $J(\\theta)$ by changing the values of the vector $\\theta$, not by changing $X$ or $y$. [Refer to the equations in this notebook](#section2) and to the video lectures if you are uncertain. A good way to verify that gradient descent is working correctly is to look at the value of $J(\\theta)$ and check that it is decreasing with each step. \n",
    "\n",
    "The starter code for the function `gradientDescent` calls `computeCost` on every iteration and saves the cost to a `python` list. Assuming you have implemented gradient descent and `computeCost` correctly, your value of $J(\\theta)$ should never increase, and should converge to a steady value by the end of the algorithm.\n",

However, the following is still considered a matrix `np.array([[1, 2, 3]])` since it has two dimensions, even if it has a shape of 1x3 (which looks like a vector).\n",

    "Given the above, the function `np.dot` which we will use for all matrix/vector multiplication has the following properties:\n",
    "- It always performs inner products on vectors. If `x=np.array([1, 2, 3])`, then `np.dot(x, x)` is a scalar.\n",
    "- For matrix-vector multiplication, so if $X$ is a $m\\times n$ matrix and $y$ is a vector of length $m$, then the operation `np.dot(y, X)` considers $y$ as a $1 \\times m$ vector. On the other hand, if $y$ is a vector of length $n$, then the operation `np.dot(X, y)` considers $y$ as a $n \\times 1$ vector.\n",
    "- A vector can be promoted to a matrix using `y[None]` or `[y[np.newaxis]`. That is, if `y = np.array([1, 2, 3])` is a vector of size 3, then `y[None, :]` is a matrix of shape $1 \\times 3$. We can use `y[:, None]` to obtain a shape of $3 \\times 1$.\n",
